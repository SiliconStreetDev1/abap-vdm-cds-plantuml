# ABAP VDM / CDS Multi-Engine Diagram Generator 🚀

Visualize your SAP CDS Virtual Data Model (VDM) hierarchies with ease.

The **VDM Diagram Generator** is an ABAP tool designed to recursively discover and visualize CDS View relationships. Supporting **ASSOCIATIONS**, **COMPOSITIONS**, and **INHERITANCE**, this tool parses your metadata via the XCO Framework to generate syntax for your preferred rendering engine.

### 🚀 What's New
The generator has been completely re-architected to support a **multi-engine rendering model**. 
* **Three Output Formats:** Natively supports **PlantUML**, **Mermaid.js**, and **D2 Lang**.
* **Universal Configuration:** A single rendering configuration object controls layout, routing, and themes across all engines natively.
Method pattern.

## 📋 Compatibility & Requirements

* **Primary Support:** **SAP S/4HANA 2023** and higher.
* **Legacy Support (S/4HANA 2022):** The tool may function on 2022, but it is **not fully supported**.
    * *Note:* The XCO Framework underwent significant API changes between 2022 and 2023. You may encounter "Method Not Found" exceptions or incorrect cardinality mapping on older releases.
* **XCO Framework:** Standard availability in modern S/4HANA and BTP is required.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Extensibility

The solution uses a strict **Template Method** design pattern. The heavy lifting (looping, scope checking, cardinality logic, and data cleansing) is locked inside the Abstract Base Engine. The concrete subclasses act purely as syntax translators.

### Core Components
1. **`ZIF_VDM_DIAGRAM_RENDERER`**: The external contract defining the universal config and the `build( )` method.
2. **`ZIF_VDM_DIAGRAM_HOOKS`**: The internal interface defining the exact rendering exits (e.g., `on_entity_start`, `on_relationship`).
3. **`ZCL_VDM_DIAGRAM_BASE`**: The abstract engine. It consumes the XCO metadata and orchestrates the calls to the interface hooks.
4. **The Renderers**: Subclasses that redefine the hooks to output specific diagram syntax.

### 🔌 How to Add a New Format
Adding a new diagram language (e.g., DOT, Structurizr) requires **zero** changes to the SAP data extraction logic. 
1. Create a new class: `CLASS zcl_vdm_diagram_custom INHERITING FROM zcl_vdm_diagram_base.`
2. Redefine the `zif_vdm_diagram_hooks` methods.
3. Use the protected `add_text( )` method to append your specific syntax inside the hooks.

## 🎨 Supported Renderers

| Renderer | Best For | Output Style  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **PlantUML** | Complex, highly detailed enterprise models. | UML Class Diagrams | 
| **Mermaid.js** | Quick embedding in GitHub, Azure DevOps, or Markdown. | UML Class Diagrams | 
| **D2 Lang** | Modern, clean, declarative diagrams. | SQL Table Shapes |

---

## ☁️ Cloud (BTP/ABAP Cloud) vs. On-Premise 
The tool utilizes the Adapter Pattern to handle environment differences:
* **On-Premise:** Broader access to the ABAP Repository. Includes fallback logic to parse DDL source code via regex if the XCO API encounters unreleased or complex UNION/JOIN statements that the standard API cannot yet handle.
* **Cloud (BTP / Public Edition):** Restricted to Tier 1 (Cloud Optimized) ABAP. The generator only interacts with "Released" entities or those within your own software components. Low-level DDIC table reads (like `DDDLSVRC`) are prohibited.

---

## ⚙️ Parameter Reference

The generator is designed for inline usage. You pass a `selection` structure (what to draw) and a `config` structure (how to draw it) to the constructor of your chosen renderer.

### 1. Content Selection Scope (`ty_selection`)
Controls **what** data is extracted from the SAP XCO metadata and rendered onto the canvas. 

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`cds_name`** | `String` | The root CDS view to start discovery from. Engine moves **down**, unless inheritance is true (moves **up**). |
| **`max_allowed_level`** | `Integer` | Max recursion depth. Recommended: 3-5. Default is 1. |
| **`discovery`** | `Toggle` | Logic for finding inheritance, associations, or compositions without drawing lines. |
| **`lines`** | `Toggle` | Visualization settings for drawing arrows between boxes. |
| **`base`** | `Boolean` | If true, shows the data source (tables/views) at the top. |
| **`keys`** | `Boolean` | If true, displays key fields. |
| **`fields`** | `Boolean` | If true, displays all non-key fields. |
| **`associations_fields`** | `Boolean` | Lists association names inside the entity box. |
| **`custom_developments_only`**| `Boolean` | Only draws boxes for the `Z*` and `Y*` namespaces. |
| **`include_cds`** | `Table` | Whitelist: Only these views/entities will be expanded into boxes. |
| **`exclude_cds`** | `Table` | Blacklist: These views/entities will be ignored by the generator. |

### 2. Layout & Visual Formatting (`ty_render_config`)
A universal configuration object controls the layout. **Note:** Because each engine handles layout differently, unsupported parameters are safely ignored by that specific engine.

| Parameter | Accepted Values | PlantUML Engine | Mermaid.js Engine | D2 Lang Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`layout_direction`**| `TB` or `LR` | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| **`routing_style`** | `ORTHO`, `POLYLINE`, `DEFAULT`| Supported | *Ignored* (Native) | *Ignored* (Native) |
| **`theme`** | `MODERN`, `CLASSIC` | Supported | *Ignored* (CSS) | *Ignored* (Internal) |
| **`spacing`** | `WIDE`, `NORMAL` | Supported | *Ignored* (Native) | *Ignored* (Native) |

## 🧱 Field Rendering & Association Mapping

The generator provides granular control over the internal structure of the entity boxes. 

* **Key Fields (`keys`):** Rendered at the top of the box with a `*` or `+` prefix to denote primary identification.
* **Normal Fields (`fields`):** Standard non-key attributes listed below the keys.
* **Association Fields (`associations_fields`):** Lists the names of defined associations within the entity box itself.

### 🎯 Relationship Line Anchoring
The behavior of relationship lines (arrows) changes based on your `associations_fields` setting to ensure maximum clarity:

* **Standard Mode (`associations_fields = abap_false`):** Relationship lines are drawn from the **border of the source box** to the border of the target box. Cleanest view for high-level overviews.
* **Detailed Mode (`associations_fields = abap_true`):** When associations are listed inside the box, the generator anchors the relationship lines **directly to the specific field name** within the box. 
    * *Why use Detailed Mode?* Mapping lines directly to association fields is invaluable when a single CDS view has multiple associations to the same target view (e.g., `_CreatedByUser` and `_LastChangedByUser` both pointing to `I_User`).

---

## 🛠 Usage & Detailed Examples

### 1. Basic Generation with Granular Toggles
The engine splits relationship logic into two granular toggle sets:
* **Discovery (Manual Search):** Used when you want to find and display entities in the diagram **without** drawing relationship arrows (Landscape mode).
* **Lines (Auto-Discovery):** When a specific line type is enabled, the engine **automatically enables** discovery for that type.

**Discovery Only (Entities without lines):**
~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name          = 'I_BUSINESSPARTNER'
  max_allowed_level = 2
  discovery = VALUE #( inheritance = abap_true associations = abap_true compositions = abap_true )
).

DATA(renderer) = NEW zcl_vdm_diagram_plantuml( hierarchies = parsed_hierarchies selection = selection ).
DATA(plantuml_code) = renderer->build( ).
~~~

**Lines Only (Auto-discovers and draws lines):**
~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name          = 'I_BUSINESSPARTNER'
  max_allowed_level = 2

).

DATA(renderer) = NEW zcl_vdm_diagram_mermaid( hierarchies = parsed_hierarchies selection = selection ).
DATA(mermaid_code) = renderer->build( ).
~~~

### 2. Advanced Filtering: Inclusions & Exclusions
To prevent accidental empty diagrams, the root `cds_name` is always included by default.

**Inclusion Strategy:**
~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name          = 'I_BUSINESSPARTNER'
  max_allowed_level = 2
  lines             = VALUE #( associations = abap_true )
  " INCLUSION: ONLY expand these views into boxes
  include_cds       = VALUE #( ( cds_name = 'I_BPDATACONTROLLER' )
                               ( cds_name = 'I_BPRELATIONSHIP_2' ) )
).
~~~

**Exclusion Strategy:**
~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name          = 'I_BUSINESSPARTNER'
  max_allowed_level = 2
  lines             = VALUE #( associations = abap_true )
  " EXCLUDE these views from selections
  exclude_cds       = VALUE #( ( cds_name = 'I_BPDATACONTROLLER' )
                               ( cds_name = 'I_BPRELATIONSHIP_2' ) )
).
~~~

### 3. Custom Development Filter (Z/Y Namespace)
Hides standard SAP noise by only rendering entity boxes for your custom developments.

~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name                 = 'ZR_BloxUIHeaderTP' 
  max_allowed_level        = 6                   
  lines                    = VALUE #( compositions = abap_true associations = abap_true ) 
  custom_developments_only = abap_true " Only select entities starting with Z* or Y* ).
~~~

### 4. The "Kitchen Sink" / Full Layout Config (PlantUML)
Generates a highly detailed, modern PlantUML diagram showing absolutely everything.

~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name                       = 'ZI_SALESORDER'
  keys                           = abap_true
  fields                         = abap_true
  base                           = abap_true
  associations_fields            = abap_true 
  lines-associations             = abap_true
  lines-compositions             = abap_true
  lines-inheritance              = abap_true
  force_render_all_relationships = abap_false 
).

DATA(config) = VALUE zif_vdm_diagram_renderer=>ty_render_config(
  layout_direction = 'TB'
  routing_style    = 'ORTHO'  " Clean 90-degree routing
  theme            = 'MODERN' " Rounded corners, no shadows
  spacing          = 'WIDE'   " Maximum readability
).

DATA(renderer) = NEW zcl_vdm_diagram_plantuml( hierarchies = parsed_hierarchies selection = selection config = config ).
DATA(diagram_code) = renderer->build( ).
~~~

### 5. The High-Level Architecture (Mermaid.js)
Strips away noise, hiding fields and base tables. Perfect for GitHub Markdown.

~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name                       = 'ZI_SALESORDER'
  keys                           = abap_false  
  fields                         = abap_false  
  base                           = abap_false  
  lines-associations             = abap_true
  lines-compositions             = abap_true
  lines-inheritance              = abap_true
).

DATA(config) = VALUE zif_vdm_diagram_renderer=>ty_render_config(
  layout_direction = 'LR' " Left to Right looks better for high-level flows
).

DATA(renderer) = NEW zcl_vdm_diagram_mermaid( hierarchies = parsed_hierarchies selection = selection config = config ).
DATA(diagram_code) = renderer->build( ).
~~~

### 6. The Pure Database Schema (D2 Lang)
Maps out a strict data schema using D2. Focuses only on keys, fields, and standard associations (foreign keys).

~~~abap
DATA(selection) = VALUE zcl_vdm_diagram_generator=>ty_selection(
  cds_name                       = 'ZI_SALESORDER'
  keys                           = abap_true
  fields                         = abap_true
  base                           = abap_true
  lines-associations             = abap_true
  lines-compositions             = abap_false " Turn off Composition
  lines-inheritance              = abap_false " Turn off Inheritance
  force_render_all_relationships = abap_true  " Force all target tables to draw
).

DATA(renderer) = NEW zcl_vdm_diagram_d2( hierarchies = parsed_hierarchies selection = selection ).
DATA(diagram_code) = renderer->build( ).
